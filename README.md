# NoMic
## What Is The Problem We Are Solving?
In a large gathering with a huge audience, when speaker asks the question to the audience and someone volunteers to answer it. Then the mic is passed to the person by another person(volunteer), making the task more complicated and time taking.
We are creating a web app that will allow the users to use their mobile phones as the secondary microphones for the auditorium speakers. 
Speaker/Host will share the unique link among the attendees, using that link attendees will get an option to speak(after host permits them to do so).
## What Is The Novelty Of Your Idea?
Right now, volunteers struggle a lot in passing the microphones to the attendee, and also it's a time taking process. Considering the time boundation given to the speaker, wasting time in this process is not worth it. 
After using this product, the time will be saved and can be utilized in learning.
## What Tech Stack Will You Be Using?
For the home page we'll be using Wix Velo. For the rest of the front end part, we'll be using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. For the backend part, we'll be using WebRTC(Web Real Time Communication), Sockets, Twilio APIs & Firebase.
